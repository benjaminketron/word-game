    ///         web or desktop application user interface. Multiple players will see the same set of starting letters and will
    ///         compete against each other to produce the longest valid word from those starting letters.Submitted words are validated against
    ///         a collection of valid words supplied in the resources/wordlist.txt file(this text file is loaded in the ValidWordsImpl class).
